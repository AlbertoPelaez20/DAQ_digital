# DAQ_digital
University project in VHDL. In this project, a digital DAQ was developed based on 8 12-bit ADCs (ADS7046), a DAC (MCP4725), and two multiplexers (74CBTLV3257-Q100). These ADCs communicate using the SPI protocol, while the DAC communicates via I2C. The sampled data is sent via UART for analysis.
